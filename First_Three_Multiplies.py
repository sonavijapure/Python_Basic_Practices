#Letâ€™s start by creating a function which both prints and returns values. 
# For this function, we are going to print out the first three multiples of a number and return the third multiple. 
# This means that we are going to print 1, 2, and 3 times the input number and then return the value of 3 times the input number.

# Write your first_three_multiples function here
def first_three_multiples(num):
  print(num * 1)
  print(num * 2)
  print(num * 3)
  return (num * 3)

# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
first_three_multiples(2)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
